This is a companion repository to a blog post about using Athena Workgroups and
AWS Lake Formation.

It demonstrates how to limit a user or role to a specific S3 output bucket,
amount of data scanned by Athena per query and the restrictions to access the
data in S3/Data Catalog (cell-level access control).

The blog post that explains the code in this repository can be found here:
